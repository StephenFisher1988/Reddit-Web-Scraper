            <h1>Life Pro Tips</h1>

            <br><hr></hr></br>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: If you think of a good idea, write it down. Your brain will try to trick you into thinking you will remember it later, but it's a liar! Therefore: Write it down!</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: Don't cheap out on Shoes and Mattresses throughout life, most of the time one of the two are supporting the whole weight of your body and poor quality can result in negative health consequences.</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: If someone is bragging about how good, caring and moral they are, it's almost guaranteed that they are the exact opposite. Never let your guard down around these people or get too friendly with them. Chances are they are gonna backstab you one way or another if or when they get the chance.</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: Your safety is more important than someone else’s feelings. If you ever get a bad vibe from someone, do what you can to distance yourself from them. It’s better to be wrong than to be a victim.</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT Request: What to spend my ' tired free-time ' at the end of my day without mindlessly scrolling down my phone, or playing video games?</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: Regardless of your political affiliation, always vote at every election. For everything from abotion to minium wage, the amount of time it takes to vote is minimal in comparison to the impact it will have on your life. People died for the right of universal suffrage. It really is that important</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT You will be judged by the company you keep</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: When booking a DJ for a wedding, let them know that you want 60% volume compared to usual weddings where they just blast everyone's ears off. Makes far more enjoyable time for everyone!</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: If you have small children who are starting to walk, decide NOW what items are precious to you and you absolutely cannot lose/replace and do not ever let them get near them, no matter how much they beg. Kids up to at least teenage years will VERY likely destroy anything they get their hands on.</p>
				</article>

				<article>

					<p> 
LPT: To make any cheap wig look better, add baby powder to it and work it into the hair (fingers or brushing). It will decrease shininess and add depth. Good luck with your costumes and have a happy Halloween!</p>
				</article>
